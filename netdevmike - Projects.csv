Project Description</h2><h3>1.1 Background</h3><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) ensures that users are given sufficient levels of access to cloud resources and no more. As companies grow, the number of IAM users and access keys increases but they often overlook when there is a need to review and scale down, such as when employees leave the companies or a particular access key is no longer required. This poses a security risk to the company cloud infrastructure as unused users or keys can be exploited to illegally access the servers, and with privilege escalations in case the users being exploited have too much access, they can severely damage the company system or extract sensitive data for ransoms.</p><p>Automated IAM Clean-up addresses the security problem of unused IAM users and access keys by periodically checking the status of IAM users and associated access keys and sending the report to designated emails. With predetermined conditions, idle users can be automatically deleted from the system and administrators can see the output from an automatically generated report. </p><h3>1.2 Description of the business and Cloud benefits examined</h3><p>Leaving individuals with access to critical accounts can result in serious problems. The solution to this is access management automation to keep track of user access and remove IDs when necessary. In Cloud an IAM is an ID, it provides access privileges to applications, data, and functionality. Many businesses still rely on manual IAM management either due to budget constraints or complacency. </p><p> </p><p>Examples of organizations that may benefit from Automated IAM Clean-up may be an organization with high turnover, those with a large list of contractors, or a University. Looking at the University example, they constantly have a large number, sometimes in the 1000s, of students graduating, leaving, transferring, etc. To manually remove each student IAM would not only be taxing an individual, it is prone to errors. Automating the removal process will negate the threat of possible missing a students IAM access privileges leading to security issues. </p><p> </p><p>There is currently a rapid proliferation of various identities associated with cloud service environments. Simply, the more cloud services used by an organization, the more identities are provisioned for these environments. Identity and access management (IAM) management has become increasingly more difficult. </p><p> </p><p>Improper de-provisioning of IAM roles for former employees or students Software as a Service (SaaS) accounts shows a lack of control over account lifecycle. Taking all of these into consideration, IAM Automated Cleanup project will be beneficial within large organizations where manual checks would lead to mistakes and exposures.</p><h3>1.3 Cloud deployment plan and strategy</h3><p>We will need an AWS account and particularly following services: CloudWatch Events &amp; Logs, SNS, IAM, Lambda &amp; S3</p><p>CloudWatch Events will trigger the lambda function based on predefined conditions. CloudWatch Logs will monitor and log the lambda function executions. SNS will deliver email notifications of new Access Reports to users that subscribe to the topic. IAM will be used to determine access to resources, with the goal of achieving least privilege permissions. It will grant access to the S3 bucket to view reports and also access to managing the lambda function, events and logs. Lambda function will be the main idea in this architecture and will retrieve and analyze IAM users and access keys and add them to an access report based on determined conditions. S3 will be used to store the Access Report logs in a centralized location.</p><h3>1.4 DevOps/DevSecOps recommendations*</h3><p>CloudWatch and CloudTrail of AWS should be enabled to use the IAM Cleanup tool. Tool should leverage these services to monitor and log efficiently and create reports for deserted users. There is no particular requirement for Lambda function deployment since it would be very basic and compatible in every possible situation when it is properly deployed.</p><h3>1.5 High availability and fault tolerance recommendations*</h3><p>The IAM Cleanup uses various AWS services that already offer high availability such as CloudWatch, SNS, Lambda &amp; S3. For example:</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CloudWatch Logs and Events are managed services that capture logs and fire events at scheduled intervals. There is no server to manage.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SNS is a publish-subscribe service maintained by Amazon, provides a reliable mechanism for our script to execute and inform IT admins promptly at the end of its execution.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lambda is a serverless function as a service, also managed by Amazon. This gives an advantage that the script can run reliably and predictably, without us worrying about server resources.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;S3 is an object storage service with high availability, durability and infinite scalability. The final reports in S3 are, therefore, always accessible.</p><p>As a result, the Automated IAM Cleanup is highly available and fault tolerant by design, since all of its components are managed and maintained by AWS. &nbsp;</p><h3>1.6 Business continuity and disaster recovery recommendations*</h3><p> </p><p>Given a scenario that a University runs a web application to manage students’ course registrations and materials at <a href=""http://www.example.com/"">www.example.com</a>. When a staff in the IT department leaves and his IAM user, which originally has a very broad permission policy, is not cleaned up, the result is the system is vulnerable to IAM-related attacks. In this case, the attackers can either bring down the system, or cause damage to existing data, resulting in system downtime and potential data loss. Two BC &amp; DR solution strategies that minimize the impacts of such incidents are Warm Standby and Multi-Site.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Warm Standby</strong>: also called an active-passive setup where there is a scaled-down, fully functional, standby infrastructure in another Region. This strategy decreases the time to recovery because the application is always running in another Region. When there is an incident in the production infrastructure, the standby, scaled-down infrastructure can take over and handle traffic. It also can scale up to meet the higher traffic from the production site.</p><p> </p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/62b21e17f19e8de7080321f8_Picture1.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption>(Hararei, n.d.)</figcaption></figure><p>As such, the RTO can be very fast as traffic can be redirected to the standby stack within 15 minutes. &nbsp;RPO will also be very short, ranging from a few minutes to under 3 hours, as the database server in the standby stack is a replication of the primary database in the production stack. In case an incident occurs, RPO is the time it takes to reverse replicate from the standby database to the primary database.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Multi-Site:</strong> Also called an active-active setup which runs a fully set-up, fully functional, and fully scaled copy of production infrastructure in another region. To prepare, a fully scaled version of production infrastructure is set up and running in another region, ready to take traffic without any scaling up required.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/62b21e3ea382ec6e836d7846_Picture2.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption>(Hararei, n.d.)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Recovery: when there is an incident in the production infrastructure, it just takes an DNS swapping to bring up the system.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/62b21e5e7029f7362f85876f_Picture3.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption>(Hararei, n.d.)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p> </p><p>As such, the RTO can be real-time. &nbsp;RPO will also be very quick, in minutes, &nbsp;as the database is an active replica of the primary database.</p><h3>1.7 Threat Modeling and Mitigation*</h3><h4>Use Scenarios</h4><p>ID - Description</p><ul><li>1 - Insecure S3 bucket policy</li><li>2 - Unprotected AWS root user access of IAM user</li><li>3 - Vulnerable lambda function implementation</li><li>4 - Use IAM to control access on S3 and Amazon SNS</li><li>5 - Ensure S3 reports are not publicly accessible</li></ul><h4>External Dependencies</h4><p>The External Dependency lists dependencies on Cloud services that can impact security.

Third-party audit reports can be done using AWS Artifact (AWS, 2022).</p><h2>2. Cloud Solution Architecture or Implementation Solution</h2><h3>2.1 Security Use cases</h3><p>Security use cases are clear in the architecture. IAM cleanup project will retrieve and analyze IAM users and access keys to evaluate these users according to predetermined conditions. Idle users will be removed automatically and the whole process would be logged and reported to administrators, execution logs will be stored by CloudWatch. This will decrease the chance of overlooking old accounts and thus limit the risk of credential exposure, bad access etc. in the long run drastically. All activity within the system will be logged into CloudTrail for accountability. The reports generated by the system will be securely stored and encrypted.</p><h3>2.2 Security Requirements</h3><p>The security requirements that must be addressed with the proposed solution are the following:</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) &amp; Identity Provisioning: The solution must provide a means through which access to resources can be managed and provisioned securely by granting or revoking roles.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Least privileged access: This is one of the most critical security requirements, access control will be managed in such a way that only the required capabilities are granted for each role. Additionally, any role that is determined as non-needed any longer will be automatically removed or included in a report to be considered for removal by an administrator.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Separation of duties: Access control must be managed so that key management access is segregated into key administrator roles.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Storage and compute isolation: Any application data and compute resources cannot be accessible to any co-residents. &nbsp;</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Storage data protection: Any sensitive data should be securely stored and encrypted.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Logging and auditing: There should be a record of events in the system, so that each action is recorded and can be traced to its source.

The users either left the organization or their permissions were revoked due to department transfers, or for other reasons. The access keys that were created a long time ago and are not actively tracking at the moment. When these resources are inactive for a long time, they are at risk of being misused or leaked and should be monitored carefully. Examples of such incidents are: running a script on EC2 instances, modification of IAM policies, modification of security groups, etc…</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Protect</p><p>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Automated IAM Clean-Up in this report provides a proactive protection operation that periodically scans and cleans up all inactive users and keys, preventing them from accessing the system illegally.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Detect</p><p>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When incidents occur, Amazon GuardDuty can detect backdoors to EC2 instances, privilege escalation and unauthorized access. There are also tools such AWS CloudTrails that trace all the API calls in AWS that we can use to detect incidents regarding IAM users and keys.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Respond</p><p>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The immediate actions to respond to IAM-related threats are to disable the users and keys, effectively shutting down the unauthorized access. Then, an analysis should be conducted to review the areas that were accessed and what damages have been done. We should also review the IAM Clean-up function to tweak certain parameters such as the Inactivity Window to further harden its security control.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recover</p><p>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unauthorized accesses, particularly those using highly privileged permissions, might cause considerable damages to the cloud infrastructure. To recover from such incidents, continuous backups and snapshots are key to ensure the smooth recovery. Periodically reviewing IAM users and keys should also be considered to proactively prevent these incidents.</p><p> </p><h3>2.7 Applied Security Design Patterns and Best Practices (Optional)</h3><p>The following best practices should be followed for IAM </p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lock AWS root account’s access keys, which are the most powerful keys that have full access to the Cloud infrastructure. </p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid using passwords or access keys. Instead, use IAM roles to access AWS services, which are more secure and have no long-term credentials to maintain.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Grant the least possible permissions to users requesting access. These make sure that persons are able to perform the necessary actions.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use AWS managed policies, which are predefined, managed and controlled by AWS for a certain set of permissions.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Validate IAM policies before and during their lifecycle, to make sure that the policies are up-to-date and suitable for what they are for.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Create a strong password policy for all users</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enable Multi-Factor Authentication, which requires IAM users to do 2-step authentication with either a hardware or software token generator.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enforce a policy to block sharing access keys</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rotate access keys regularly</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clean up obsolete and unnecessary users and keys</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Continuously monitor activities in AWS Cloud by using tools such as CloudTrails, Cloudwatch, GuardDuty.</p><p>(AWS, 2022)</p><h3>2.8 Guidance for Security &amp; Compliance assessments</h3><p>Security assessments for IAM can be done as follows:</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Identify all IAM actions and policies that are not resource-constrained. Usually, an action should be tied to specific AWS resources. Wildcard (*) actions should be flagged out for more extensive monitoring and audits. Examples: s3:GetObject, ssm:GetParameter, or secretsmanager:GetSecretValue which are considered as data exfiltration commands.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watch out for IAM Roles that can be assumed by AWS Compute Services such as EC2, ECS, EKS, or Lambda, as they can pose greater risk than user-defined roles, particularly resources that are configured to access the Internet.</p><p>Compliance assessments can be done with AWS Audit Manager, which automatically runs compliance monitoring scripts to ensure IAM credentials such as users and access keys comply with relevant industry standards or specific compliance programmes. </p><h3>2.9 Security Testing*</h3><p>Penetration Testing such as IAM privilege escalation can be used to challenge the IAM system. The following scenarios are examples:</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An attacker using a user’s credential with permissions such as iam:PassRole and ec2:RunInstances permissions can create an EC2 instance and pass an existing role to it. They can then login to the instance and request the associated AWS keys from the EC2 instance metadata, which ultimately gives them access to all the permissions that the associated instance profile has.</p><p>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An attacker with the iam:CreateAccessKey can create an access key for other users and assume the other users’ roles to access AWS services.</p><p> </p><h2>3. Conclusions and Recommendations </h2><p>Project scenario requirements are to showcase “Cloud Security” and demonstrate overall learning of security concepts applied to real-world Cloud deployment scenarios. Our project, Automated IAM User Cleanup, involves deploying an AWS Lambda function with AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to provide regular insights on IAM Users and AWS Access Key usage within an account. This allows organizations to secure their AWS account aligned with the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Most specifically, the Security Pillar which focuses on the protection of information and systems. This pillar specifically mentions managing user permission which the automation of IAM cleanup improves dramatically. Upon implementation, results identify orphaned IAM users and AWS Access Keys, take action to remove IAM Users automatically, and AWS Access Keys no longer needed, and reduce identity sprawl. This adequately meets the first part of the stated project scenario requirement. The project showcases Cloud Security and demonstrates our overall learning of security concepts. In addition to the aforementioned, we also implemented the following best practice security strategies. We blocked all public access to the S3 bucket, used KMS in the lambda python script to encrypt the access key and key id both in the script and in transit to ensure storage protection. Additionally, we used EventBridge to deliver real-time data from AWS to the AWS Lambda function to ensure isolation by removing the need of having any exposed lambda endpoints. The logging was addressed by recording all lambda execution logs into CloudWatch.CloudTrail was implemented to fulfill the requirement of being able to audit any action within the system since it records all event history as well as the user or service that initiates it. This history is searchable and downloadable which creates a trail for an AWS admin user to monitor and audit.</p><p>This project may be applied in real-world cloud deployment solutions for organizations with a high turnover. It is highly undesirable to have employees who have left an organization to maintain access and privileges. Universities would also have a use case scenario for this Automated IAM User Cleanup solution as they constantly have students leaving. To manually remove and track perhaps hundreds of students each year is near impossible. </p><p>Taking a closer look at the organization's scenario and reviewing the possible situations where Automated IAM User Cleanup is not implemented, employees and contractors are the number one cause of data breaches, and the majority (56%) of security professionals say insider threats are on the rise according to a Haystax, a threat prevention company, survey. Privileged users with access to sensitive information are thought to pose the most significant threat (60%), with consultants and contractors a close second (57%), followed by regular employees (51%). These threats are believed to be on the rise due to a few reasons: insufficient data protection solutions and strategies, an increased number of devices with access to sensitive data, and more employees, contractors, and partners accessing the network. The City of Calgary in Canada was sued for $92.9 million in 2017 for a privacy breach impacting more than 3,700 of its employees. Disgruntled employees may cause situations of similar consequence. Perhaps they feel unjustly let go, overlooked for a promotion, or even attempting to gain a competitive advantage for a new employer (RedTeamSecurity, 2022). </p><p>Automating the reduction of employees removed from an organization using this architecture will assure that individuals’ IAM credentials are removed appropriately and reduce the risk of this occurring dramatically. </p><p>There are many additional examples of similar situations: the former network administrator for the city of San Francisco held the city's systems hostage by refusing to give up the passwords. Why? He felt his supervisors were incompetent. A network engineer for oil and gas company EnerVest found out he would be fired and sabotaged the company's systems by returning them to their original factory settings. A hospital worker stole forms containing patient information and is thought to have filed fraudulent income tax returns. Keep in mind that it is more difficult to detect and prevent internal attacks than external attacks. Haystax’s respondents would agree with this at a rate of 66%. These are just a few of many thousands of real-world examples which could have been prevented if their credentials had been correctly removed. (RedTeamSecurity, 2022)</p><p>Our recommendation for all organizations is to follow security best practices and use cases in AWS Identity, and Access Management provided by AWS. Continue to use least privilege IAM policies, lock your AWS account root user access keys, use access levels to review IAM permissions, enable MFA, and follow Security best practices in IAM. AWS provides these best practices and, if followed, will help secure AWS resources. In addition to AWS best practices, we would recommend Automating IAM User Cleanup to avoid a potential security risk at a high financial cost.<br></p><p> </p><h2>4.

The company invests only in the stock market. At the end of each trading day, the company would like to generate and post the listing of its stocks so that investors can see how their holdings performed that day. We assume that the company invests in, say, 10 different stocks. </p><p>The desired output is to produce two listings, one sorted by stock symbol and another sorted by percent gain from highest to lowest.

In the first step (part a), design and implement a stock object. In the second step (part b), design and implement an object to maintain a list of stocks.a. (Stock Object) Design and implement the stock object. Call the class that captures the various characteristics of a stock object stockType.The main components of a stock are the stock symbol, stock price, and number of shares. Moreover, we need to output the opening price, closing price, high price, low price, previous price, and the percent gain/loss for the day. These are also all the characteristics of a stock. Therefore, the stock object should store all thisinformation. Perform the following operations on each stock object: </p><ul><li>Set the stock information. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Print the stock information. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Show the different prices. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Calculate and print the percent gain/loss. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Show the number of shares. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;a.1. The natural ordering of the stock list is by stock symbol. Overload the relational operators to compare two stock objects by their symbols. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>a.2. Overload the insertion operator, &lt;&lt;, for easy output. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>a.3. Because the data is stored in a file, overload the stream extraction operator, &gt;&gt;, for easy input. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>For example, suppose infile is an ifstream object and the input file was opened using the object infile. Further suppose that myStock is a stock object. Then, the statement infile &gt;&gt; myStock; reads the data from the input file and stores it in the object myStock. (Note that this statement reads and stores the data in the relevant components of myStock.)</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>Create a stock list</h4><p>b. Now that you have designed and implemented the class stockType to implement a stock object in a program, it is time to create a list of stock objects.Let us call the class to implement a list of stock objects stockListType.The class stockListType must be derived from the class listType, which you designed and implemented in the previous exercise. However,the class stockListType is a very specific class, designed to create a list of stock objects. Therefore, the class stockListType is no longer a template.Add and/or overwrite the operations of the class listType to implement the necessary operations on a stock list.The following statement derives the class stockListType from the class listType.class stockListType: public listType&lt;stockType&gt;</p><p>{ &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member list</p><p>};</p><p>The member variables to hold the list elements, the length of the list, and the maximum size of the list were declared as protected in the class listType. Therefore, these members can be directly accessed in theclass stockListType. Because the company also requires you to produce the list ordered by the percent gain/loss, you need to sort the stock list by this component. However, you are not to physically sort the list by the component percent gain/loss. Instead, you will provide a logical ordering with respect to this component.To do so, add a member variable, an array, to hold the indices of the stock list ordered by the component percent gain/loss. Call this array sortIndicesGainLoss. When printing the list ordered by the component percent gain/loss, use the array sortIndicesGainLoss to print the list. The elements of the array sortIndicesGainLoss will tell which component of the stock list to print next.</p><p>‍</p><p>c. Write a program that uses these two classes to automate the company’s analysis of stock data.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal"" style=""max-width:5%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""normal"" data-rt-max-width=""5%""><a href=""https://github.com/MichaelCharara/Cplusplus-programming/blob/main/Programming_Assignment_9.cpp"" target=""_blank""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/617ed8d4a239186e56fa5a43_5847f98fcef1014c0b5e48c0.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""GitHub Logo""></div></a><figcaption>View this project on GitHub</figcaption></figure>",stock market trading company automation,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/611429c6ef832e86bc135221_C%2B%2B%20Program.PNG,Webflow,false

Identity Services Engine Portal,identity-services-engineer-portal,611274296df83830737ec3ab,617edaeba3530e6c0703ceab,Sun Oct 31 2021 18:05:31 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Oct 31 2023 00:42:39 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Tue Oct 31 2023 00:43:19 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Cisco,"<h3>Objective and Rationale Behind Identity Service Engine</h3><p>‍<br>At the start of this project, we had multiple <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/access/wireless/software/guide/ServiceSetID.html"">Service Set Identifiers (SSID)</a>, one for guests, one for employee BYOD, another for apple BYOD devices, and more. We wanted to consolidate all of these SSIDs into a single SSID for the nearly 60-acre campus. To accomplish this, we wanted a portal that would display a login screen and an optional link for guest users to create a temporary account upon connecting to the network. We also did not want the guest wireless network to interact with any of our production devices and be isolated via a firewall.</p><p>This project revolved around moving our current bring your own device (BYOD) solution to the &nbsp;Cisco Identity Service Engine. Our organization provides free internet access to guests visiting for a short period. Cisco ISE creates local accounts for Guests. We also had instituted a policy that allows the employees to connect their devices such as smartphones to the corporate wireless network and use it for business purposes. This is referred to as the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy. However, since the individuals own these devices, they don’t like to install management software that allows organizations to “manage” the endpoint. </p><p>‍<br>We went with Cisco ISE as it allows us to create accounts for visitors and authenticate them for audit purposes. Cisco ISE also provides a set of APIs to integrate with other systems such as vendor management systems to create, edit and delete Guest accounts. The built-in Certificate Authority (CA) to make and help distribute certificates to different devices was also a factor in onboarding aspects of the BYOD process. The built-in CA provides a complete certificate lifecycle management. </p><p>‍</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/617f0b1bbfffe922db1a16a6_ISE-BYOD-Solution.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""ISE BYOD Solution"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption>image from cisco.com</figcaption></figure><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/617f0b0e8164cc559fff295a_ISE-Guest.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""The 3 types of guest access"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div><figcaption>image from cisco.com</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Every Cisco ISE session begins with authentication, whether to a user or a device. Authentication can be active authentication or passive authentication (not including 802.1X session): An authentication is done using 802.1X when Cisco ISE authenticates the user against an Identity Source. In contrast, in passive authentication (Easy Connect), Cisco ISE learns about the user after the user authenticates against the Identity Source like Microsoft’s Active Directory (AD), and the AD notifies ISE.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Devices Involved:</h4><p>Current Wireless Lan Controller: <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/series.html"">Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers</a></p><p>Current Anchor: <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/5520-wireless-controller/datasheet-c78-734257.html"">Cisco 5520 Wireless Controller</a></p><p>Access Point: <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/aironet-3800-series-access-points/datasheet-c78-741682.html"">Cisco Aironet 3800 Series</a></p><p>Outdoor Access Point: <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/aironet-1560-series/datasheet-c78-737416.html"">Cisco Aironet 1560 Series Outdoor</a></p><p>‍</p><h3>What is the Identity Service Engine and the Identity Services Engine Passive Identity Connector</h3><p>Cisco <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/web-security-appliance/guide-c07-741643.html"">web security appliance</a> can authenticate proxy users actively against LDAP or active directory servers. The WSA can also passively identify proxy users without direct communication to a directory server. Authentication is accomplished using the <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/web-security-appliance/guide-c07-741637.html"">Cisco identity service engine</a> or ISE. ISE is an influential center for all things authentications. It is capable of enforcing network access using 802.1x, radius, or web authentication. ISE any or all these mechanisms to build a user session database containing the username, IP address, mac address security group tag, and more. ISE then makes this database available using an API called the platform exchange grid or PxGrid. The WSA can connect to ISE via PxGrid and subscribe to user authentication sessions. This allows the WSA to obtain user to IP mappings and security groups tags for all known network users. The WSA can also connect to the external restful service or ERS in the latest versions and obtain user group information without ever contacting the director server. Certificates must be generated and installed on both ICE and the WUSA. PxGrid is accessible Over a mutually authenticated TLS connection meaning that certificates must be used to authenticate both the client and server-side. This requires specially designed certificate templates when using active directory integrated certificate authorities. Details on how to integrate the solutions, including configuring an active directory certificate authority and issuing the certificates, are available below.</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/617f09e9ca16ae33f9272b72_ISE.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Identity Service Engine Passive Identity Connector"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>‍<br>When a user logs on the network, they are authenticated to ice using any number of methods that are independent of the WSA. They may be authenticated using a switch that is capable of 802.1x, mac authentication bypass, or even web authentication redirect. Once this happens, the session is created in the ISE database. The WSA connection to PxGrid is always on. The User, IP, and SGT information are populated in the WSA ISE datastore. When the client its first web request through the WSA, they are easily identified without the need for active authentication. ISE can also identify users without requiring active authentication. </p><p>Available in every ISE installation is the <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/2-2/pic_admin_guide/PIC_admin/PIC_admin_chapter_01011.html"">Passive identity (PassiveID)</a> feature. Instead of relying on 802.1x or web authentication, this feature can connect to active directories using the windows management instrumentation interface and subscribe to specific events in the Windows security event log. PassiveID can also consume cis log messages to identify user login events. When a user logs into their domain computer, an event is generated which triggers ISE to create a user session. This session is also available to the WSA over PxGrid. Passive ID is available in the complete ISE installation or as a stand-alone virtual appliance known as the Identity Services Engine Passive Identity Connector or ISE-PIC. This is a stripped-down version of ISE without features like profiling, security group tags, or 802.1x. It operates the same way as the passive identity feature in the full ISE product. ISE-PIC is positioned as the successor to the context delivery agent or CDA. CDA also subscribed to the windows event log to learn about a user through IP mapping but does not provide as many features as ISE-PIC, such as ERS for group information, active endpoint probes, and Syslog providers. The configuration on the WSA is the same for ISE-PIC as it is for ISE. </p><p>Once ISE or ISE-PIC is configured with the WSA, user and group information may be used in various policy contracts in the WSA. In the identity profile, the WSA can attempt to identify a user transparently ISE, and if no information is available, fall back to active authentication. This removes load from WSA authentication services. The information retried for the WSA from ISE can be used in decryption policies and access policies. IF ISE-PIC is used, the available criteria are username and group membership. While the security group tag is present, ISE-PIC does not support them. If ISE is used, the available criteria are security group page, username, and group membership. In version11.8, both AD and ISE information can be used in an individual policy. This allows for the use of fallback when user and group information is not available in ISE, and active authentication through a direct server is used instead.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Complications, Resolutions, Current State</h3><p>‍<br>We integrated ISE into the network, but we had a problem where the CNA was not popping up for apple devices. We believe this may have something to do with the <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-1/configuration-guide/b_cg81/b_cg81_chapter_01010111.pdf"">captive network assistant bypass</a> being enabled. We had enabled the captive bypass portal following the <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/8-4/config-guide/b_cg84/wlan_security.html"">Cisco Wireless Controller Configuration Guide, Release 8.4 - WLAN Security [Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software]</a>. The captive bypass suppressed the pseudo apple browser (Captive Network Assistant) from popping up for any WLAN on that controller. Captive bypass must be enabled in the single SSID flow for BYOD. However, if this is enabled, it will suppress the mini-browser for guest flows and since there is now support for the mini-browser with ISE 2.2 there is no need to enable captive portal bypass on the controller. The client connects to the guest network, and the mini-browser will pop and auto-login. </p><p>If disabling captive bypass does not produce the desired results, there is another option we may consider. We would still like seamless flow for guests using mini-browser and BYOD on the same controller, perhaps setting up DNS-based ACLs for the ACL_BYOD_REDIRECT and adding URL captive.apple.com to the ACL_GUEST_REDIRECT, which will redirect appropriately.</p><p>The URL captive.apple.com comes from WISPr, a draft protocol that enables users to roam between different wireless service providers. Some devices (For example, Apple iOS devices) have a mechanism to determine if the device is connected to the Internet, based on an HTTP WISPr request made to a designated URL. This mechanism automatically opens a web browser when a direct connection to the Internet is not possible. This enables the user to provide his credentials to access the Internet. The actual authentication is done in the background every time the device connects to a new SSID. The client device (Apple IOS device) sends a WISPr request to the controller, checking for the user agent details and triggering an HTTP request with a web authentication interception. After verifying the IOS version and the browser details provided by the user agent, the controller allows the client to bypass the captive portal settings and access the Internet.</p><p>At this time I am currently in contact with Apple Corporate &nbsp;Support while researching possible resolutions.</p>",Implement the Cisco Identity Service Engine over a single Service Set Identifier,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/617f1503a3530e11f9051ad3_Cisco_ISE_basic.png,United Wholesale Mortgage,false

This project demonstrates the power of React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, combined with external API calls to fetch and display data dynamically. This document provides an overview of the project's objectives, requirements, and how they were met.</p><p id=""""> </p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Objective:</strong></h4><p id="""">The primary objective of this project is to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use React application for searching movies. The app should provide a seamless experience for users to search for movies, view the results, and access detailed information about each movie. To achieve this objective, the project incorporates the following key functionalities:</p><ol start=""1"" id=""""><li id="""">Search movies by title or actor using the OMDb API.</li><li id="""">Display search results in an organized list format, including movie posters and essential details.</li><li id="""">Allow users to click on a movie item to view more information.</li><li id="""">Implement a sorting functionality to enable users to sort search results by relevance, year, or alphabetically.</li></ol><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id="""">‍<strong id="""">Requirements and Implementation:</strong></h4><h6 id="""">Create a search functionality to find movies using the OMDb API.</h6><ul id=""""><li id="""">This requirement is met by implementing the 'searchMovies' function within the React app. The function fetches movie data from the OMDb API using the provided API key and API URL. The API call is made using JavaScript's Fetch API, which returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. The data is then converted to JSON format, and error handling is implemented if an error occurs during the API call. The search results are returned as an array of movie objects.</li></ul><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">const API_KEY = '96d39d7c';<br>const API_URL = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/';<br><br>const searchMovies = async (query) =&gt; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}?s=${query}&amp;apikey=${API_KEY}`);<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const data = await response.json();<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (data.Error) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong id=""""><em id="""">console</em></strong>.error(data.Error);<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return [];<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;} else {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return data.Search;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>};</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""> </p><h6 id="""">Display search results in a list format with movie posters and details.</h6><ul id=""""><li id="""">To display the search results in an organized and visually appealing manner, a 'MovieList' component is created. The component maps through the movies array and displays each movie item as a list element. Each movie item includes the poster, title, and release year. The movie posters use the 'img' tag with appropriate alt text, while the movie titles and years are displayed using 'h2' and 'p' elements, respectively. CSS styles are applied to ensure a clean and consistent layout for the movie list.</li></ul><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">const MovieList = ({movies}) =&gt; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const [selectedMovie, setSelectedMovie] = useState(null);<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const handleClick = async (movie) =&gt; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;const details = await searchMoviesById(movie.imdbID);<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;setSelectedMovie(details);<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;};<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const handleClose = () =&gt; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;setSelectedMovie(null);<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;};<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;return (&lt;&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{selectedMovie &amp;&amp; (&lt;MovieDetailsPanel movie={selectedMovie} onClose={handleClose}/&gt;)}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;ul className=""movie-list""&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{movies.map((movie) =&gt; (&lt;li<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;key={movie.imdbID}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;className=""movie-item""<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;onClick={() =&gt; handleClick(movie)}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;img<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;src={movie.Poster}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;alt={`${movie.Title} poster`}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;className=""movie-poster""<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div className=""movie-details""&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;h2 className=""movie-title""&gt;{movie.Title}&lt;/h2&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;p className=""movie-year""&gt;{movie.Year}&lt;/p&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;))}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/ul&gt;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/&gt;);<br>};</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">‍</p><h6 id="""">Allow users to view more details about a movie by clicking on the movie item.</h6><ul id=""""><li id="""">To enhance user experience, the project allows users to view more information about a movie by clicking on a movie item in the list. This functionality is implemented in the 'handleClick' function within the 'MovieList' component. When a user clicks on a movie item, the 'searchMoviesById' function is called with the movie's IMDb ID as a parameter. This function fetches detailed information about the selected movie using another API call to the OMDb API.</li></ul><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">const searchMoviesById = async (id) =&gt; {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}?i=${id}&amp;apikey=${API_KEY}`);<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const movie = await response.json();<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (movie.Error) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong id=""""><em id="""">console</em></strong>.error(movie.Error);<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return null;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;} else {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return movie;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>};</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""> </p><ul id=""""><li id="""">The fetched data is then used to create a 'MovieDetailsPanel' component that displays the movie's title, year, genre, director, actors, and plot.
