This is contrasted with $10.33 billion for Q1 2020. AWS income developed 32% in the quarter, speeding up from 28% development in the final quarter. This quarter, AWS's income represented 12% of Amazon's absolute income – and almost 47% of Amazon's generally speaking working pay. AWS keeps on reinforcing the organization all in all with its benefit. </p><p>This quarter, AWS reported that previous AWS leader and current head of Salesforce Tableau Adam Selipsky will run AWS, supplanting Andy Jassy as he climbs to head the entirety of Amazon. </p><p>Amazon's CFO, Brian Olsavsky, said on the income call with financial backers</p><blockquote>During COVID, we’ve seen many enterprises decide that they no longer want to manage their own technology infrastructure,” he said. “They see that partnering with AWS and moving to the cloud gives them better cost, better capability and better speed of innovation. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the post pandemic recovery. There’s significant momentum around the world, including broad and deep engagement across major industries.</blockquote><p>Furthermore, obviously, a large part of the development openly cloud comes from net-new responsibilities, not simply those relocated from on-premises framework. We're interested to perceive how this pattern proceeds. </p><h4>Azure</h4><p>While Amazon indicates AWS income, Microsoft just reports on Azure's development rate. That number is half income development over the past quarter – which is quicker than the 46% development examiners anticipated. This time last year, development was accounted for at 59%. You might see features promoting that ""Azure growth rates are slowing"", contrasting those income development rates. In any case, the measurement is of sketchy worth as Azure keeps on expanding income at this huge scope. </p><p>Here are the income numbers Microsoft reports. Azure is under the ""Intelligent Cloud"" business, which became 23% to $15.1 billion. The working gathering likewise incorporates worker items and cloud administrations (26% development). </p><p>Microsoft considers its to be development as key to its prosperity. President Satya Nadella said</p><blockquote>Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren’t slowing down. They’re accelerating, and it’s just the beginning. We are building the cloud for the next decade, expanding our addressable market and innovating across every layer of the tech stack to help our customers be resilient and transform.</blockquote><p>The absence of explicitness around Azure disappoints numerous intellectuals as it just couldn't measure up straightforwardly to AWS, and unavoidably causes a commotion about how Azure is truly getting along. Obviously, it likewise accepts that IaaS is the lone piece of ""cloud"" that is significant, however at that point, that is the manner by which AWS has developed to rule the market. </p><p>In any case, Microsoft's cloud business is plainly creating accomplishment for the organization. Smart Cloud conveyed the most noteworthy working pay of all fragments this quarter at $6.4 billion, which is 37.7% of absolute merged working pay. </p><h4>Google Cloud </h4><p>This quarter, Google Cloud detailed income of $4.047 billion, an increment of 46% year-over-year. Working misfortunes were $974 million, contrasted with misfortunes of $1.73 billion one year already. </p><p>Note that the Google Cloud unit incorporates Google Cloud Platform as well as Google Workspace (previously G Suite). </p><p>Like different goliaths, Alphabet featured its cloud development. Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said</p><blockquote>We’re very pleased with the ongoing momentum in Google Cloud, with revenues of $4.0 billion in the quarter reflecting strength and opportunity in both GCP and Workspace.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h4>Cloud Market Share Breakdown</h4><p>As of April 2021, <a href=""https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q121"">Canalys reports</a> that the worldwide cloud market grew 35% this quarter to $41.8 billion.

Flexible vs Static Budgeting,flexible-vs-static-budgeting,611274296df8387cb47ec3b0,61b401cc9e1bcdf1e804be1c,Sat Dec 11 2021 01:41:32 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Sat Dec 11 2021 01:44:19 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Sat Dec 11 2021 01:44:28 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3><h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of proper budgeting for an organization cannot be understated. Budgeting identifies currently available capital, provides an estimate of expenditure, and anticipates incoming revenue (Banks,2018). Businesses can measure performance against expenditure with a proper budgeting system and ensure that resources are available for programs or expenditures that support business growth and development. It enables the business owner to concentrate on cash flow, reduce costs, improve profits, and increase investment returns (Banks, 2018). A business can use two main types of budgeting: flexible budgeting and static budgeting. Each system has its pros and cons, so the decision should be carefully considered.</p><h4><strong>Analysis</strong></h4><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When deciding which type of budget system to use, the type of business the organization operates in and the business's goals should be considered. As stated above, there are pros and cons to each of the flexible and static budgeting systems, so choosing the one that works best for your organization is essential. When looking at each system more closely, we can gather when it is appropriate to use each one.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The flexible budget system adjusts based on changes in actual revenue or other activities. The result is a reasonably aligned budget with actual results (Bragg, 2021). The flexible system, in particular, uses percentages of revenue for certain expenses rather than the usually fixed numbers. This allows for an infinite series of budget changes that are directly tied to actual revenue incurred(Bragg, 2021).</p><p>One issue with the flexible approach is it can be challenging to formulate and manage appropriately. The maintenance involved in a constantly changing system can be very demanding. This maintenance may require a larger team of accountants, which raises the costs of accounting for the entire organization. Furthermore, the flexible approach tends to ignore changes to other expenses that do not change following small revenue variations(Bragg, 2021). Incorporating step costs may compensate for variations but adds more work and oversite to the budgeting process.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The static budge system varies from the flexible system in that it contains nothing but fixed expense amounts that do not vary with actual revenue levels. A static budget is a type of budget that incorporates anticipated values about inputs and outputs that are conceived before the period in question begins (Kagan, 2021). A static budget–a forecast of revenues and expenses over a specific period–remains unchanged even with increases or decreases in sales and production volumes(Kagan, 2021). The static budget helps monitor expenses, sales, and revenue, which helps organizations achieve optimal financial performance (Kagan, 2021). A problem with the static budgeting system is that it cannot forecast the organization's needed expenses and operating revenue for any given upcoming period.</p><h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Proper budgeting is vital for any organization, no matter how big or small. The static budget system may be more effective for organizations with highly predictable sales and costs for shorter-term periods—the flexible budgeting system good tool for evaluating the need for a quick change or pivot. An organization might use a flexible budget system if additional raw materials are needed as production volumes increase due to seasonality in sales or if temporary staff is needed during certain times of the year. The best practice is probably for an organization to use both systems as appropriate as both systems can offer great insight into a companies performance and outlook.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>References</strong></h5><p>Banks, K.(2018, February 28). <em>The Importance of Budgeting in Business: WLF Accounting&amp; Advisory</em>.

IT certs that sit at the intersection of systems administration and mechanization are required. We're seeing more interest form experts who have the product and robotization abilities that are required in this rapidly developing region. The Cisco DevNet gives the chance to &nbsp;validate abilities in this developing field of foundational automation.</p><p>Of course, empowering mechanization implies basic programming and scripting. These aren't generally a given for many network professionals. This is the place where Python can help. </p><p>So, for what reason would it be a good idea for you to learn Python since DevNet certs are here? The basic answer is: Cisco's suggested insight for DevNet Associate Certification incorporates: ""Hands-on experience with a programming language (specifically Python)""</p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/61166de42f553a4f9e43b768_Python_Code.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p>Python</p><p>Python has possibly become the most well known programming language. It is a universally useful programming language that is broadly utilized for various applications. Due to that extensibility, Python abilities are turning out to be more significant to employers.</p><h4>Lets Talk Python</h4><p>While Python isn't by and large new, it's ascent in prevalence as it identifies with Cisco certs is. The motivation behind why it's so broadly utilized today is on the grounds that it's anything but an exceptionally intricate language. It is intended to be easy to peruse and compose. This meaningfulness is especially significant when searching for dialects that are open to non-engineers of shifting ability levels.</p><h4>Python is Great for Your Toolbox</h4><p>Let's contrast developing your programming abilities with building your tool compartment. Assuming you need to get the most use out of what you have, you should include devices that will work for most positions. A couple of various screwdrivers, pincers, wrenches, hammer, and a drill may be a decent spot to begin. Thusly, whatever work you experience out in the field you'll have the option to begin dealing with right away.</p><p>The same line of thinking can be applied to fostering your abilities. In case you will contribute time to get familiar with a programming language, wouldn't it bode well for it to be one you are probably going to utilize most?</p><p>You need to have the right instruments to take care of business. Adapting generally utilized apparatuses first will allow you to do the most tasks — giving you the best profit from your speculation. Having this in your back pocket will help you stay in front of things. This turns out to be particularly valid for a systems administration engineer.</p><h4>Network Engineering and Python</h4><p>As was expressed previously, Python is quite possibly the most mainstream programming language right now. While an organization designer probably won't have pursued programming, having a comprehension of a basic programming language would be very useful.</p><p>Going back to the tool kit model prior, you need to arm yourself with the most helpful instruments to take care of business. For this situation Python is another apparatus that will make your life simpler. </p><figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/61166e2f2f553ac1af43b8ad_Network_Automation_Python.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><h4>How Python Applies to Cisco DevNet</h4><p>The Cisco DevNet Associate test 200-901 gets into experience with a programming language and explicitly specifies Python.</p><p>This accentuation on programming might be astounding to a few. Previously, many would not have expected such a programming center from a ""network"" seller, however circumstances are different. DevNet tends to a hole on the lookout and helps IT masters approve abilities pertinent to the present organizations. In particular, DevNet works effectively on bringing DevOps and foundation robotization into the fold.</p><p>Cisco's DevNet is heading in a similar way most businesses are going today. In case you're an accomplished engineer simply hoping to mechanize network foundation, or an organization professional hoping to get computerization, DevNet certs can help.</p><h4>Closing Thoughts</h4><p>You can't disregard the ubiquity of Python these days. If you need to set yourself up for future changes, this is the way you'll take. Possibly a couple of years not too far off, something different turns into the new focal point of Cisco DevNet tests. Be that as it may, until further notice, there it a lot of potential gain in learning Python. Of course, there are no absolutes in IT. Learning another programming language can help you, regardless of it being Python or not. In any case, you'll need to try to keep the instruments that see the most use in your tool kit. Certainly, you'll have need for others not too far off. Be that as it may, you'll need to ensure you have the right apparatuses to take care of business. Start with an all purpose item - than figure out if you could use something more niche like a ratchet adapter later.</p>","Taking a look at the Cisco DevNet, its pros, cons, and what makes it significant.",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/6112dc09f879c157f6c6b1f2_Silvia_Spiva_Cisco_DevNet_developer_video_channel_customer_partner_success_stories.png,true,network-engineer,Tue Aug 10 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Central to this evolution is the juxtaposition of modern and postmodern assumptions. Both paradigms provide a unique lens to view and guide leadership, and understanding these assumptions can enrich one's approach to leading teams in today's complex environment.</p><p id="""">‍<br></p><h3 id="""">Modern Assumptions:<br></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Objective Reality:</strong> Modernism relies heavily on the idea that there is a single, knowable truth or reality. In this view, leadership is about identifying and aligning with this objective reality.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Hierarchical Structures</strong>: Teams operate best within clear hierarchies. Leaders provide top-down direction and have a clear and authoritative role.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Rationality is Supreme: </strong>Decision-making is primarily based on logic, evidence, and reason. Emotional or intuitive reasoning is often seen as inferior.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Standardization and Consistency:</strong> Best practices exist and should be consistently applied. Once a successful method is identified, it is replicated across the board.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Control and Predictability</strong>: Effective leadership is about controlling variables and predicting outcomes. The more a leader can control, the more effective they are assumed to be.<br>‍<br></p><h3 id="""">Postmodern Assumptions:</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Subjective Realities: </strong>Postmodernism posits that individuals construct reality and can differ from person to person. Leadership, then, is about navigating these multiple realities.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Flattened Structures:</strong> Hierarchies are limiting. Teams operate best when power dynamics are minimized, and members collaborate as equals.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Embrace of Multiplicity:</strong> Multiple ways of knowing—including emotional, intuitive, and experiential—are embraced. Diverse perspectives enrich decision-making.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Contextual Practices: </strong>What works in one context might not work in another. Leaders and teams must be adaptable and open to change rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Embrace of Uncertainty: </strong>The future is unpredictable, and control is an illusion. Leadership is about adaptability, resilience, and embracing ambiguity.</p><p id="""">‍<br></p><h3 id="""">Implications for Team Leadership:</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Modern Leadership: </strong>Typically, a leader operating from a modernist perspective will focus on strategic planning, setting clear roles and responsibilities, and ensuring consistency and efficiency in processes. They may prioritize measurable outcomes and data-driven decisions.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Postmodern Leadership:</strong> Leaders with a postmodern stance are likely to foster environments where team members feel empowered to share their unique perspectives. They will value adaptability and creativity and might be more willing to experiment with unconventional approaches. Collaboration, dialogue, and co-creation are emphasized.</p><p id=""""><br></p><h3 id="""">The Postmodern Era of Team Leadership:<br></h3><p id="""">We find ourselves now firmly entrenched in the postmodern era of team leadership. As our society becomes increasingly interconnected and diverse, the principles of postmodernism have taken root in many facets of leadership.</p><p id="""">Here's why we can confidently say we are in a postmodern leadership age:</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Globalization and Diversity:</strong> With globalization, teams often consist of members from varied cultural, social, and educational backgrounds. The concept of a single, overarching truth or method becomes elusive in such diverse settings. Each team member brings unique perspectives and realities, making postmodern leadership approaches more relevant.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Digital Transformation:</strong> The digital age has revolutionized the way we work. Hierarchies are less clear in virtual spaces, and the lines between roles can blur. The rapid pace of change and the decentralized nature of digital teams lean more toward the postmodern assumption of uncertainty and adaptability.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Value of Empathy and Emotional Intelligence:</strong> Modern leadership often prioritizes rationality over emotion. However, today, there's a growing recognition of the importance of empathy, emotional intelligence, and human connection in leadership. This shift resonates with postmodern ideals.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Agile and Adaptive Approaches:</strong> Look at the rise of methodologies like Agile in project management and leadership. They prioritize adaptability, continuous feedback, and iterative progress—hallmarks of a postmodern approach.</p><p id="""">	</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Challenging Established Norms:</strong> Today's teams often challenge the status quo, asking 'why' and 'how can it be better?'. This intrinsic questioning of established methods and a move away from standardization highlights the postmodern era's influence.<br></p><p id="""">Incorporating postmodern assumptions into team leadership doesn't mean we abandon all modernist principles. Instead, we see a synthesis where leaders pick the best tools from both paradigms. However, given the current trends and challenges, postmodern leadership is not just a theoretical approach but a practical response to today's complex world.</p><p id="""">‍<br></p><h3 id="""">Conclusion:</h3><p id="""">Neither the modern nor postmodern approach can be deemed universally 'right' or 'wrong.' The effectiveness of each depends on the context. For example, postmodern leadership might be more effective in a rapidly changing tech startup. On the other hand, in a large-scale manufacturing firm, modern leadership might yield better results.</p><p id="""">The key for today's leaders is to be aware of these assumptions, evaluate their context, and adapt their leadership style accordingly. It's not about choosing one over the other, but rather integrating insights from both paradigms to lead effectively in a complex world.</p><p id="""">‍</p>","In team leadership, there is a continuous evolution of thought and practice.

While still functional, these applications can often become a bottleneck for businesses, as they must catch up with the pace of innovation and changing business needs.</p><p id="""">One solution for addressing these issues is to move from legacy applications to microservices. Microservices is an architectural approach that involves breaking down a monolithic application into a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network.</p><p id="""">There are several benefits of moving from legacy applications to microservices. Firstly, microservices allow for faster and more efficient development and deployment of new features and functionality. Each microservice can be developed and deployed independently, so new functionality can be introduced without disrupting the entire system.</p><p id="""">Secondly, microservices allow for more flexibility in terms of technology choice. As each microservice is a separate entity, different microservices can be built using different technologies, allowing for the use of the best tool for the job. This also allows for more efficient use of resources, as each microservice can be optimized for its specific purpose.</p><p id="""">Thirdly, microservices allow for easier scaling and maintenance. As each microservice is independent, it can be scaled up or down as needed without affecting the rest of the system. Additionally, as each microservice is separate, it can be updated or maintained without disrupting the entire system.</p><p id="""">However, it's worth mentioning that migrating from legacy applications to microservices is a challenging task, and it's essential to have a well-planned approach. I think it's best to start small by identifying functionality that can be broken into a microservice and then build on that. It's also essential to clearly understand the current system and its dependencies so that the migration process can be managed to minimize disruption to the business.</p><p id="""">In conclusion, moving from legacy applications to microservices can provide significant benefits for businesses, including faster development and deployment of new features, greater flexibility in technology choice, and easier scaling and maintenance. However, migrating from legacy applications to microservices is not trivial and requires a well-planned approach. By starting small and clearly understanding the current system, businesses can successfully transition to microservices and improve the efficiency and scalability of their IT systems.</p>",A look at why moving from legacy applications to microservices is advisable,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611274296df838894e7ec3aa/63ceafe2ea260c5d15e78a8c_Microservices-scaled.jpeg,true,devops-engineer,Wed Dec 07 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
